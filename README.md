# Decorator Pattern
This project demonstrates the Decorator Pattern by allowing dynamic composition of HTML tags.
This approach uses inheritance for the base tag classes and composition for decorators, providing a clean, extensible way to generate rich HTML elements programmatically.

Note: This is a homework exercise in design patterns, and does not follow HTML best practices.
